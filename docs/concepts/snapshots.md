# Snapshots

A snapshot is an immutable record of a workspace's file state at a point in time. Snapshots form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) through parent references, enabling merge-base computation and history traversal.

## Snapshot Metadata

Each snapshot is stored as a `.meta.json` file in `.fst/snapshots/`. The full metadata structure:

```json
{
  "id": "a3f2b1c4d5e6...",
  "workspace_id": "ws-...",
  "workspace_name": "main",
  "manifest_hash": "sha256hex...",
  "parent_snapshot_ids": ["parent1hex...", "parent2hex..."],
  "author_name": "John Doe",
  "author_email": "john@example.com",
  "message": "Add authentication module",
  "agent": "claude",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "files": 42,
  "size": 128000
}
```

The `manifest_hash` links to a manifest JSON file in `.fst/manifests/{hash}.json` that contains the full file listing with per-file SHA-256 hashes, sizes, and modes.

A minimal `SnapshotMeta` (in `internal/config/config.go`) is used for resolution: `id`, `created_at`, `manifest_hash`, `parent_snapshot_ids`, `author_name`, and `author_email`.

## Snapshot IDs

Snapshot IDs are content-addressed: the ID is a 64-character lowercase hex SHA-256 hash derived from the snapshot's identity fields. This means any tampering with metadata is detectable — the ID won't match the recomputed hash.

The hash input is a canonical byte string:

```
snapshot\0
manifest_hash <hash>\n
parent <sorted-parent-id>\n
author <name> <email>\n
created_at <rfc3339>\n
```

Parents are sorted lexicographically before hashing for determinism. Fields excluded from the hash (mutable metadata): `message`, `agent`, `workspace_id`, `files`, `size`.

Implementation: `internal/config/snapshot_id.go` (`ComputeSnapshotID`, `VerifySnapshotID`, `IsContentAddressedSnapshotID`).

IDs can be resolved by prefix — if a short prefix uniquely matches one `.meta.json` file, it resolves to the full ID. Ambiguous prefixes return an error. Implementation: `internal/config/config.go` (`ResolveSnapshotIDAt`).

### Legacy IDs

Older snapshots may have a `snap-` prefix (randomly generated). These are recognized as legacy IDs and skip integrity verification on read. New snapshots always use content-addressed IDs.

### Integrity Verification

When reading a content-addressed snapshot (via `ManifestHashFromSnapshotIDAt` or `SnapshotParentIDsAt`), the ID is re-derived from the stored metadata fields and compared. If they don't match, the read fails with an integrity error. This catches accidental or malicious edits to `.meta.json` files.

## The DAG

Snapshots reference zero or more parent snapshot IDs in `parent_snapshot_ids`:
- A regular snapshot has one parent (the previous `current_snapshot_id`)
- A merge snapshot has two parents (the local head and the merged-in head)
- The first snapshot in a workspace has no parents (or inherits from the fork point)

Parent IDs are resolved at snapshot creation time via `resolveSnapshotParents`, which checks for pending merge parents first (written by the merge command), then falls back to `current_snapshot_id`.

Implementation: `cmd/fst/commands/snapshot.go` (`resolveSnapshotParents`).

## Merge Base Algorithm

Finding the common ancestor between two workspace heads uses BFS on the snapshot DAG, implemented in `internal/dag/mergebase.go` (`GetMergeBase`):

1. BFS from the target head to build a distance map (snapshot ID to distance)
2. BFS from the source head, checking each visited node against the target distance map
3. When intersections are found, the algorithm minimizes the combined distance (source distance + target distance)
4. Ties are broken by preferring the more recently created snapshot (by `created_at` timestamp)
5. The search prunes early: if the current source distance already exceeds the best known combined score, it stops

Snapshot metadata is loaded from either workspace's `.fst/snapshots/` directory via `LoadSnapshotMetaAny`.

## Snapshot Creation Flow

`fst snapshot` (implemented in `cmd/fst/commands/snapshot.go`):

1. Resolves the author identity (project-level > global > interactive prompt)
2. Generates a manifest of the current filesystem (respecting `.fstignore`), hashing every file with SHA-256
3. Populates the stat cache (`.fst/stat-cache.json`) so subsequent status/drift checks can skip rehashing unchanged files
4. Computes the manifest's SHA-256 content hash
5. Computes the content-addressed snapshot ID from identity fields
6. Caches all file blobs in the project-level blob store (`.fst/blobs/`)
7. Saves the manifest JSON to `.fst/manifests/{hash}.json`
8. Writes snapshot metadata to `.fst/snapshots/{id}.meta.json`
9. Updates `current_snapshot_id` in config
10. Clears any pending merge parents

Options:
- `--message` / `-m`: Required description for the snapshot
- `--agent-summary`: Auto-generates a description using a configured AI agent
- `--agent`: Records which AI agent made the changes (auto-detected from `FST_AGENT` env var)

### Auto-Snapshots

`CreateAutoSnapshot` is used internally by merge and sync to create safety snapshots before destructive operations. It skips creation if the manifest hash matches the current snapshot (no changes).

## Snapshot History

`fst log` displays the snapshot chain starting from `current_snapshot_id`, walking backwards through `parent_snapshot_ids[0]`. Use `--all` to show all snapshots sorted by time regardless of chain membership. Output includes shortened IDs, relative timestamps, file counts, sizes, agent tags, and messages.

Use `--graph` / `-g` to display a git-log-style DAG visualization alongside the log entries. This follows all parent links (not just first-parent), topologically sorts the results, and renders column-based graph lines showing merges and forks. The `fst dag` command provides a similar project-wide DAG view across all workspaces.

Implementation: `cmd/fst/commands/log.go` (`walkSnapshotChain`, `runLogGraph`), `internal/dag/graph.go` (`GraphRenderer`, `TopoSort`).

### TODO

- ~~Add `fst gc` to delete orphaned snapshots/manifests~~ (done)
